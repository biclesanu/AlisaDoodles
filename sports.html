                        When I was 7 years old, a karate club started teaching Ashihara karate lessons at my school's gym. I got really excited when I heard the announcement and I begged my parents to let me join. I started practincing two times a week, and it lasted 7 years. During this time, I adopted a disciplined lifestyle thanks to the principles they taught us along with the sport itself.
                        I reached a high performance level, I participated in numerous local and national competitions and camps. I also took Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu courses.

                        I had to stop karate due to a body injury, and I took a few months off any phisical activity. After enough recovery, I tried new sports that were suitable for my medical issues. I got into street dance classes for a year. They were fun and they helped me stay active and feel like I am part of a sport's group again. After that, I started swimming lessons, and I practiced swimming until the pandemic started. During the pandemic, I tried jogging and at home fitness. Since the end of lockdown I started going to a fitness gym.

                        For the near future I plan to get into swimming again. In the long run I see myself getting into the world of martial arts, since karate is still my favourite sport.
