                        Since I was a kid, I have loved painting and drawing. Every time I learned a new technique of drawing, I felt artistically powerful and I was excited to surprise myself with my skills. Over time, I finished a lot of sketchbook projects, canvas paintings, clay figurines, handmade jewelry etc. Decorating my room is also a form of art I always practiced (that turned into decorating my family's house at some point). I painted my room's walls, I placed posters and stickers everywhere. I personalized as many objects as possible, by painting them. My parents are my biggest fans and they have always supported me in everything, including art.
