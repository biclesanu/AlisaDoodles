                        Since I was a kid I loved painting and drawing. Everytime I learned a new tehnique of drawing, I felt artiscally powerfull and I was excited to surprise myself with my skills. Over time, I finished a lot sketchbook projects, canvas paintings, clay figurines, handmade jewlery etc. Decorating my room is also a form of art I always practiced (that turned into decorating my family's house at some point). I painted my room's walls, I placed posters and stickers everywhere, I personalized as many object as possible, by painting them. My parents are my biggest fans and they have always supported me in everything, including art.
