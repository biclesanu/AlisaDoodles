                        My family consists of my mother, my father, my brother and I. My mother and father are two loving, fun and caring parents, but most importantly they are also my friends. My brother is one of the coolest people I know, we share a lot of common interests and when we spend time together we never fail to make each other laugh. I know I always have my family's support in everything I do.

                        Tedi
                        <br></br>
                        Tedi is my pet budgie. I adopted him in April 2022. We spend a lot of valuable time together. We sing and dance together to music (he's a big fan of soft rock) and we do homework together.
